# Seismic_Processing_Demos
Simple demos to learn seismic data processing

This toolbox will demonstrate an easy way to run various seismic data processing technqiues. All the technqies will have some flavour of 
Compressed Sensing. Each application contains a PDF document explining the porblem and solution.

%% Seismic data interpolation




%% Source-separation (deblending)



%% Denoising



%% Wave-separation



%% Wave-equation based imaging and inversion




%% Wave-equation based migration velocity analysis
